This is an out-of-channel beta for YARG + stage kit support

The release is windows only.

It should be able to work with any chart that YARG can load that has a Venue track.

Just be sure the kit is plugged in. No need to 'add a player' with the kit as the controller.

However, it does take an input slot, as it uses Xinput which has a maximum of 4 connected inputs (controllers, etc).

Please report any buys to The Fat Bastid on the YARG discord:
